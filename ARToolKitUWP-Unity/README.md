## Scripts
- ```ARUWPNative.cs``` directly interfaces with ARToolKitUWP wrapper. It defines the entry point of native functions with parameter correctly marshaled, and various constants used for tracking configuration.
- ```ARUWPMarker.cs``` defines a marker to be tracked by ARToolKitUWP, and relates tracking result with particular GameObjects in the scene.
	* ```Editor/ARUWPMarkerEditor.cs``` customizes the Unity inspector of ARUWPMarker objects.
- ```ARUWPController.cs``` configures the behavior of ARToolKitUWP.
- ```ARUWPUtils.cs``` provides various utility functions serving the package.

## Streaming Assets
Files in this folder are shipped with the application, which means they will also be accessible during runtime. Marker configurations, pattern definition, camera calibration files are placed here.

```hololens896x504.dat``` is the camera calibration file of my HoloLens locatable camera. Details can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/qian256/HoloLensCamCalib/tree/master).
